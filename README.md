## Description
_This is a program that will calculate a person's age in Earth years, Mercury years, Venus years, Mars years, and Jupiter years. It will also determine how many years a person has left to live on each planet, based on the average life expectancy for that person's demographic. If a user has surpassed their life expectancy, it will return the number of bonus years they have lived!_

## Known Bugs

* _Does not take into account months. If a user's birthday has not yet happened for the year, it will return the age they will become, not their current age._
* _For years left or bonus years lived on Jupiter, it will only return round numbers, so it is not highly accurate._
